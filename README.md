## Description

Third project made for Udacity Front-End Nanodegree.

A responsive browser-based card matching game.

## How To Play

You can clone this repository and open the game in the browser by clicking on index.html or open the [live version](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/fabimel/MemoryGame/blob/master/index.html) of it.


## Instructions

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

Each turn:

The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

If the user wins a congratulation panel will appear on the screen showing the number of stars and moves and the time the user took to complete the memory game. Moreover, the panel will give the user the chance to play again.

Stars rating:

3 stars if the user makes less than 20 moves

2 stars if the user makes less than 40 moves

1 star if the user makes more than 40 moves
